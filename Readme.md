# Customer Demo App

## Requirements

Is required to run the application the following parts:

* **Docker**
* **docker-compose** 
* **make** Is required to runs the one line commands available.

**NOTE: This documentation supposes that you already have the installation of docker and docker-compose** 

## Repository Structure

There are only two folders at the root of the repository which are the following:

```
Repository
│
└───api
└───docker-compose
└───frontend-app
```

The **api folder** has the laravel API with all the required files and the **frontend-app folder** contains the NodeJS client app in React that consume the Laravel API. The **docker-compose** folder contains any required file for the initialization or configuration of the containers.


### Make Installation

If you do not have **make** installed in you computer you can use the following command depending of the OS.

**Windows**

In case of Windows I recommend [chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/) to install just run the following command in Administrator access of PowerShell:

`Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))`

And then just install make with the following command:

`choco install make`

**MAC OS**

In case of Mac just install [brew](https://brew.sh/index_es) with this command:

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

And then just install make with the following command:

`brew install make`

**Linux**

For Linux is just install make with the package manager installed, here are some examples:

In case of Debian or Ubuntu:

`sudo apt-get install make`

In case of Arch linux:
`sudo pacman -Sy make`

## How to run the application

There are multiple commands available for running the multiple options when you are located in the root folder of the project:

* `make local`: This will allow you to set up the local environment with all the required dependencies.

* `make test-front-end`: To run all the unit testing for the front-end.

* `make test-back-end`: To run all the unit testing for the back-end.
 
## How to use the application

After both parts of the application are running you just need to go with the internet browser to the address http://127.0.0.1:3000/ which is the one pointing at the front-end.

The Front-End App is just a simple list with all the customers with a hyperlink in each Id in the Id column that goes to the details screen that will show all the information stored in the API of the specific customer clicked.

## Special Notes

There is a possibility that in Linux the program runs slower than normal, that's because the WSL on Windows is not managing well the volume mounting for the PHP app. You can solve the problem by disabling the WSL 2 option in docker settings (I don't recommend this option because can cause issues in the native configuration of docker, which can require a lot of extra troubleshooting).
